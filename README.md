#Bwork framework
Is a light PHP MVC framework that allows you to make your own websites and have easy access to all of its components. Almost all resources are extendable and it is easy to make your own versions of everything.

This is the alpha release and will not yet have support for bugs as I have to upgrade alot of it myself.
